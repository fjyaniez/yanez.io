  <h1 class="post-title">About me</h1>
  <div class="post-line"></div>

  <p>Hi! I’m Francis and this is my life in pictures:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/about-me.jpg" alt="My life in pictures" title="About me" /></p>

<p><strong>And that’s it for the highlights.</strong> The rest of my time I spend doing what I’m really passionate about. I’m a computer engineer, CTO and co-founder of Nazaríes IT, a general development enthusiast and particularly about Ruby on Rails and its whole ecosystem.</p>

<p>Honoring clichés, I consider myself a geek, I love learning and designing architectures for applications and systems and also love best practices.</p>

<h2 id="a-bit-of-background">A bit of background</h2>

<p>In 2009, my partner and I co-founded Nazaríes IT, a technology consultancy where I continue to work today as CTO and currently employ over 40 people.</p>

<p>Over these years I have been involved in consultancy and development of different international projects, in which I’ve learned to work with cross-functional teams of over a hundred people. I’ve also maintained relations with clients, managed teams, planned and developed projects, designed architectures and performed software deployments.</p>

<p>I’ve performed in several different roles, not just the ones related to technology like <em>full-stack</em> developer, <em>software architect</em>, <em>database administrator</em> and <em>system administrator</em>, but also in other business-oriented roles like <em>business analyst</em>, <em>UX designer</em>, <em>QA</em>, <em>sales</em> and <em>project manager</em>.</p>

<p><strong>Where do I feel most comfortable?</strong> I love believing in a product, designing it, monitoring its development and watching out for every small detail along the process. Similarly, once launched, I like doing a step by step analysis of the product’s performance and to be involved in its marketing and evolution.</p>

<p>Some of the projects I am or have been responsible for on a technical level and I feel the most proud of are:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Skade</strong>. Skade or <em>Skaði</em>, in honor of the Nordic goddess of Winter and the flag-ship project during the foundation of Nazaríes IT, is an integral management platform for highway administration during winter. Still functional since 2009 in legacy mode, it was designed for tracking fleets of vehicles destined to the conservation and maintenance of highways and motorways, as well as weather and irrigation stations in Spain. Besides being able to control the weather status through a network of stations installed in strategic locations, the status of thousands of vehicles and what they are doing (as in movement, control of the status of the shovel and sprayer for snowplows), it also controls the automatic irrigation of salted water (salt brine) in several viaducts of the Spaniard road network. If the system detects that there’s a freezing road risk, it automatically activates the sprayers through irrigation automaton (when this was implemented, neither Machine Learning nor AI were popular concepts).</li>
  <li><strong>Tercermilenio TV.</strong> Although it was only operative until 2013, this video on demand and live video platform got up to 200,000 unique visitors a day. It wasn’t a project owned by Nazaríes IT, but a development for a client. It was a challenge to upload terabytes of video for the users, to balance out loads, and also add social components for users to be able to rate and comment videos while optimizing infrastructure expenses.</li>
  <li><strong>Ceres</strong>. Following <strong>Skade</strong>’s success, in 2011 we started working on <strong>Ceres</strong> (Greek goddess of agriculture), web solution for crops monitoring. It features a more modern interface and architecture, and it remains operational today with hundreds of devices connected.</li>
  <li><strong>Port Monitor</strong>. Tired of editing XML files and installing agents to monitor all web projects we created in Nazaríes IT with <em>Nagios</em>, I implemented our own web solution similar to <em>Pingdom</em>. I then offered it to the public as a beta and later with subscription payments, and although I abandoned its development beyond basic maintenance since 2015, it still gets new subscriptions and we have a user base that loves the solution. It has scalability issues.</li>
  <li><strong>Nazaríes IoT platform</strong>. Launched at the beginning of 2017, it is the evolution of both <strong>Skade</strong> and <strong>Ceres</strong>.  It basically is a custom IoT platform, which receives data from any IoT device: cars, weather stations, cameras, water treatment facilities, irrigation systems, garbage pick-up systems, fish farm stations… It is horizontally scalable, and it has had performance peaks of up to 25.000 transactions per second. It is not 100% micro-services oriented, but it is not monolithic either. You could say that it’s something in between and it’s working really well. It storages terabytes of data and as of now, except for some solvable problems, is scaling up.</li>
</ul>

<p>In other projects I haven’t been involved as <em>product owner</em> but I have left a little piece of myself as consultor during their development, in their architecture, and <em>management</em>. These projects were developed for big, multinational clients and are used by hundreds of thousands of users. I’ve learned so much from this consultancy position, and it makes me feel incredibly lucky.</p>

<h2 id="so-whats-next">So what’s next?</h2>

<p>I’ve reached a turning point where I feel the need to develop a new product I really believe in.</p>

<p>A project that makes me feel so motivated that is the last thing I think about before going to bed and the first thing in my mind when I wake up, one I can put all my energy and talent in without any distractions.</p>

<p>And so the countdown begins…  🚀😉</p>
