A selection of articles I found interesting this May. I get them mostly from *Hacker News* so I also link the HN thread in the discussion link.

### [Why we should bulldoze the business school][1]
A critic to business schools written by someone that has been working and teaching in one of them for 20 years ([discussion][2]).

### [You are probably not getting enough sleep, and it is killing youÂ ][3]
One more interesting article about the caveats of not getting enough sleep ([discussion][4]).

### [After 5 years and $3M, here's everything we've learned from building Ghost][5]
![Ghost metrics][image-1]
Ghost, the story of a bootstrapped business based on open-source with yearly revenue of $1.2 million ([discussion][6]).

### [Reality driven development][7]
Waterfall, Kanban, Scrum and reality ([discussion][8]).
