I apologize as I'm not a native English speaker and the majority of the publications in this personal blog will be in Spanish.

When using a technical language, I feel entirely comfortable in English, and there so I'll write those technical articles first in English and then translate them into Spanish, so this blog has both versions.

However, I'll be writing a lot of nontechnical articles too like different kind of reviews about books, movies and music, personal stuff and news articles.

I don't feel comfortable enough yet to use English as my primary language for those nontechnical articles, so I'll write them in Spanish and won't probably have an English version.

This is why this site will have more Spanish content than English, and I apologize in advance.

Thank you so much for your comprehension!
