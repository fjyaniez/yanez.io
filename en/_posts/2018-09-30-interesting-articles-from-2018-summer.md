I've been a little busy this summer taking a rest, but I'm back again with the selection of articles I found interesting during my "disconnection". As usual, I get them mostly from Hacker News, so I also link the HN thread in the discussion link.

### [ The Annoying Habits of Highly Effective People ][1]
Your circumstances are different, so don't try to copy wealthy people ([discussion][2]).

### [ Why are Enterprises so Slow ][3] 
We all know enterprises are slow, so let's read the umpteenth article about it ([discussion][4]).


### [ How to fail as a new engineering manager][5] 
Good lecture for engineers that are discovering the management world ([discussion][6]).


### [ Why You Should (And Shouldn’t) Join a Startup ][7] 
Pros and cons about working for a startup or enterprise ([discussion][8]).


### [ ‘Find Your Passion’ Is Awful Advice  ][9] 
Kill the clichés ([discussion][10]).
